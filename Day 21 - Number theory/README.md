## Inclusion - Exclusion

#### 1. Total Count

Find numbers which are less than or equal to M and divisible by first N prime numbers.

sample input:

M = 30

N = 3

sample output: 22

Constraints:

1<= M <= 10^15

1<= N <= 20

#### 2. Divisiblity

Given an array arr, return the number of integers between l and r, inclusive, that are divisible by at least one of the elements in arr.

sample input:
l= 579000, r= 987654
N = 2 (size of array)
a= [1, 2]

sample output: 408655

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 18

1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

1 <= l <= r <= 10^9
