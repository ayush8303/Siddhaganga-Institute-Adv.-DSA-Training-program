## Inclusion - Exclusion

#### 1. Total Count

Find numbers which are less than or equal to M and divisible by first N prime numbers.

sample input:

M = 30

N = 3

sample output: 22

Constraints:

1<= M <= 10^15

1<= N <= 20

#### 2. Divisiblity

Given an array arr, return the number of integers between l and r, inclusive, that are divisible by at least one of the elements in arr.

sample input:

l= 579000, r= 987654

N = 2 (size of array)

a= [1, 2]

sample output: 408655

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 18

1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

1 <= l <= r <= 10^9

## Prime Number

#### 2. Count Prime

Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.

Constraints : n <= 10^6

sample input:

n = 10

sample output: 4

Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

#### 2. Prime sum

You are given a number n. Find all the pairs (l, r) such that l <= r and their sum is also prime and no more than n.

Note: l and r should be prime too.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5

Example:

Input: n= 5

Output: 1

Explanation:

In this case only pair (l, r) suits us - (2,3), because 2+3=5 , 5 is prime.
