#### 1. Run Length Encoding

Write a Program to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters, also known as Run Length Encoding. Let see one example, the input string "aaaabcccccaaa" would become "a4b1c5a3". If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your function should return the input string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters. You may use the to_string(int) method to convert an integer into string.

sample input : bbbaaaadexxxxxx

sample output: b3a4d1e1x6

sample input: abc

sample output: abc

#### 2. Palindrome Break

Given a palindromic string of lowercase English letters palindrome, replace exactly one character with any lowercase English letter so that the resulting string is not a palindrome and that it is the lexicographically smallest one possible.

Return the resulting string. If there is no way to replace a character to make it not a palindrome, return an empty string.

sample input : abccba

sample output: aaccba

sample input: aba

sample output: abb

sample input: a

sample output: ""

#### 3. String Normalisation

You are given a sentence with words separated by spaces.

Your task is to:

Write a function that returns a copy of this sentence where all the words:

1. Start with a capital letter

2. The rest of the letters are lower case

Note: Your function should not modify the sentence given as argument.

sample input: This is SO MUCH FUN!

sample output: This Is So Much Fun!
