#### 1. Odd or Even Number

Read a number N and print whether it is odd or even.

sample input: 7

sample output: odd

#### 2. Sum of digits

Write a program that reads a positive integer N as an input and prints the sum of digits of the number.

sample input: 47
sample output: 11 = 4 + 7

#### 3. Fizz Buzz Problem

Write a program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

sample input: 5
sample output: 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz

#### 4. Armstrong Number

Write a program that reads an input and checks whether the given number is an Armstrong number or not. If the number is an Armstrong number, print 1 otherwise print 0

Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits

sample input: 153
sample output: 1
Explanation: (1 _ 1 _ 1 ) + (5 _ 5 _ 5) + (3 _ 3 _ 3) = 153

#### 5. Factorial of a Number

Write a program that reads a non-negative integer N as input and prints the factorial of n.
sample input: 5
sample output: 120
Explanation: factorial of 5 is 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 5 = 120.

#### 6. Sum of digits at odd position

Write a program that reads a positive integer N as an input and prints the sum of digits at odd position of the number.

Note : The first digit of the number from the left is assumed to occupy the first (odd) position.
sample input: 548
sample output: 13

#### 7. Fibonacci Series

WAP that reads a number N and prints Nth Fibonacci number.

The Fibonacci series is an infinite series, starting from 0 (0th term) and 1 (1st term), in which every number in the series is the sum of two numbers preceding it in the series.
sample input: 2
sample output: 1
Explanation: The series is 0 1 1

#### 8. Prime Numbers Till N

Given a positive integer N greater than 1, WAP that prints all the prime numbers from 2 to N.
