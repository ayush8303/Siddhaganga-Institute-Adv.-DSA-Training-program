#### 1. Replace Bits

You are given two 32-bits numbers, N and M and two bit positions i and j. Write a program to set all bits between i and j in N equal M.
M (becomes a substring of N starting from bit j to bit i).

sample input:
N = 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
M = 1 0 1 0 1
i = 2
j = 6

sample output: 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0

#### 2. Count set bits

Write a program to count set bits in a number.

sample input:
N = 9

sample output: 2 (binary representation of 9 is 1001)
