#### 1. Subtree Count

You are given a tree with N nodes rooted at 1 where each node is number from 1 to N. The tree is given as
an array of edges where edges[i] = [ui, vi] is a bidirectional edge b/w node ui and vi.
Also you are given an array of queries where query[i] = ui, you have to count the number of nodes present in the subtree of node ui for each query.

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^5

1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
