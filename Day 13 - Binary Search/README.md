#### 1. Frequency Count

Given a sorted array which can contain repeated elements and an element K, we need to find the
the frequenct of a given element K.

sample input: arr = [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 10] , k = 2

sample output: 3

#### 2. Min pair

Given two non-empty arrays, find the minimum absolute difference between any pair of
numbers (one from each array).

sample input: n = 5, m = 6

arr1 = [-1, 5, 10, 20, 3]
arr2 = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17, 150]

sample output: 3 (between pair 20 and 17)
