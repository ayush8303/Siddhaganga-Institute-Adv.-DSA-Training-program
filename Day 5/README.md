#### 1. Shortest Path

Suppose you want to go a location, located at (X,Y starting from origin 0,0).
Your friend tells you a long way by telling the steps you should walk in each distance(N, W, E or S). Find the shortest path.

sample input: NNNEEWS
sample output: NNE / ENN

#### 2. Largest Frequency character

Write a program takes a string S as input and prints largest frequency character.

sample input: abbbccccdd
sample output: c

sample input: avddda
sample output: d

#### 3. Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

sample input: s = anagram, t = nagaram
sample output: 1

sample input: s = rat, t = car
sample output: 0

#### 4. Is String a palindrome?

Write a program takes a string S as input and prints 1 if it is palindrome or 0 otherwise.

sample input: aabaa
sample output: 1

sample input: abcde
sample output: 0

#### 5. Check for Subsequence

Given two strings str1 and str2, find if str1 is a subsequence of str2.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

sample input: str1 = "AXY", str2 = "ADXCPY"
sample output: 1

sample input: str1 = "AXY", str2 = "YADXCP"
sample output: 0
